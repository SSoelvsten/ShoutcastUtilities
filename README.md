# Stream_txt_Manager

A small java program to manage the .txt files used for the text on an overlay during a shoutcast:

- Full team name / player name
- Team tag / Abbreviation
- Score

These can be changed before commiting to the the .txt files, making for a better viewing experience.
More importantly, it offers a quick score incrementer and also a swap button, when the players switch colors and/or sides.
