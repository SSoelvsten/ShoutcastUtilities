# Shoutcast Utilities
These are a collection of programs I've made to make the running of a stream a little less cumbersome. Currently it only consists of one program.

## Team Score .txt Manager

A small java program to manage the .txt files used for the text on an overlay during a shoutcast for both teams:

- Full team name
- Team tag
- Score

These can be changed before commiting to the the .txt files, making for a better viewing experience. It also offers a score incrementer and also a swap button, which is handy when the players switch colors and/or sides.

Link the .txt files outputted into OBS and you're ready to go!
